    "The Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_{PF}$, is defined in the dipole approximation as:\n",
    "$$\\hat{H}_{PF} = \\hat{H}_e + \\hat{H}_p + \\hat{H}_{ep} + \\hat{H}_{dse}\\tag{1}$$\n",
    "***\n",
    "### *Electronic Term*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The term $\\hat{H}_e$ represents the electronic Hamiltonian and is given through:\n",
    "$$\\hat{H}_e = \\sum^{N_e}_{i} \\hat{T}_e(x_i) + \\sum^{N_e}_i \\sum^{N_N}_A \\hat{V}_{eN}(x_i :X_A) + \\sum^{N_e}_i \\sum^{N_e}_j (\\hat{V}_{ee}(x_i, x_j) + V_{N,N}\\tag{2}$$\n",
    "Where $\\hat{T}_e(x_i)$ is the electronic kinetic operator for electron $i$, $\\hat{V}_{eN}(x_i:X_A)$ is the attractive coulomb operator for electron $i$ and nucleus $A$, $\\hat{V}_{ee}(x_i : x_J)$ is the repulsive coulomb operator for electrons $i$ and $j$, and $V_{N,N}$ is the total repulsive coulomb potential between all nuclei. When using the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation, the term $V_{N,N}$ is treated a constant. Additionally, we can neglect the nuclear kinetic energy, and the electron-nuclear attraction will depend upon the coordinates of the fixed nuclear coordinates.\n",
    "***\n",
    "### *Photonic Term*\n",
    "\n",
    "The next term considered within the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian is the photonic Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_p$, which is defined as:\n",
    "$$\\hat{H}_p = \\omega\\hat{b}^{\\dagger{}}\\hat{b}\\tag{3}$$\n",
    "Here, $\\omega$ represents the frequency of a photon. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### *Bilinear Coupling Term*\n",
    "The third term in the Hamiltonian is a bilinear coupling term that describes coupling of the photonic and electronic degrees of freedom given by, $\\hat{H}_{ep}$ and is defined as:\n",
    "$$\\hat{H}_{ep} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2}}\\left(\\lambda \\cdot (\\hat{\\mu} - \\langle \\mu \\rangle )\\right)\\left(\\hat{b}^{\\dagger{}}+\\hat{b}\\right)\\tag{6}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\lambda$ describes the coupling strength, $\\hat{\\mu}$ is the dipole operator, and $\\langle\\mu\\rangle$ is the molecular dipole expectation value in the ground state. Here, the expectation value has characteristic Cartesian components, denoted by $\\xi$. A given dipole operator with $\\xi$ components is defined through:\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\mu}^{\\xi} = \\sum^{N_e}_i \\hat{\\mu}^\\xi (x_i)+{\\mu}_{nuc}^\\xi \\mid \\xi \\in \\{x,y,z\\}\\tag{7}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\mu^{\\xi}(x_i)$ is defined as an operator that depends upon electronic coordinates, and $\\mu_{nuc}^{\\xi}$ is the nuclear dipole moment where the Cartesian components are treated as functions of the nuclear coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### *Dipole Self Energy Term*\n",
    "The final component of the Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_{dse}$ is the dipole self energy term, and is defined through:\n",
    "$$\\hat{H}_{dse} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\lambda \\cdot (\\hat{\\mu} - \\langle\\mu\\rangle)\\right)^2\\tag{8}$$\n",

    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### *Hartree-Fock Reference*\n",
    "Having discussed the terms that comprise our Hamiltonian, we can now begin our CQED procedure, which we initiate through the introduciton of a product wavefunction, $|R\\rangle$. Here, we define $|R\\rangle$ through the following: \n",
    "$$|R\\rangle = |\\Phi_{0}\\rangle |0\\rangle\\tag{9}$$\n",
    "Here, we have defined $|R\\rangle$ as the product wavefunciton between an electronic Slater determinant, $\\Phi_{0}$ and a zero-photon number state, $|0\\rangle$. We can begin by performing a canonical RHF calculation to initialize the Slater determinant. \n",
    "With $|R\\rangle$ defined, we can now apply Equation 9 to Equation 1, arriving at the following:\n",
    "$$\\langle R|\\hat{H}_{ep}|R\\rangle + \\langle 0|\\hat{H}_{p}|0\\rangle + \\langle \\Phi_{0}| \\hat{H}_{e} + \\hat{H}_{dse}|\\Phi_{0}\\rangle\\tag{10}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are using a zero-photon number state, we find that the $\\hat{H}_{ep}$ and $\\hat{H}_{p}$ terms both go to zero, leaving behind only the $\\hat{H}_e$ and $\\hat{H}_{dse}$. The resulting terms are seen in Equation 11.\n",
    "$$\\langle\\Phi_{0}|\\hat{H}_{e}|\\Phi_{0}\\rangle + \\langle\\Phi_{0}|\\hat{H}_{dse}|\\Phi_{0}\\rangle\\tag{11}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From this new equation, our CQED-RHF implementation differs from ordinary RHF via the dipole self energy term--as $\\hat{H}_{e}$ provides the ordinary RHF energy. \n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Dipole Self Energy Term Expansion\n",
    "In order to better understand the role of the dipole self energy term, we will look at its expansion. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{H}_{dse} = \\sum_{\\xi, \\xi^{'}}\\sum_{i,j>i}\\lambda^{\\xi}\\lambda^{\\xi^{'}}\\hat{\\mu}^{\\xi}(x_i)\\hat{\\mu}^{\\xi^{'}}(x_j) \\\\- \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\xi,\\xi^{'}}\\sum_{i}\\lambda^{\\xi}\\lambda^{\\xi^{'}}\\hat{Q}^{\\xi\\xi^{'}}(x_i) \\\\+ (\\lambda\\cdot\\mu_{nuc}-\\lambda\\cdot\\langle\\mu\\rangle)\\sum_{\\xi}\\sum_{i}\\lambda^{\\xi}\\hat{\\mu}^{\\xi}(x_i) \\\\+ \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda\\cdot\\mu_{nuc})^2-(\\lambda\\cdot\\langle\\mu\\rangle)(\\lambda\\cdot\\mu_{nuc}) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda\\cdot\\langle\\mu\\rangle))^2\\tag{12}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this expansion of the dipolse self energy term, we observe several unique terms show up. We observe both 1- and 2-electron electronic dipole contributions, as well as 1-electron quadrupole contributions. The first two terms within this expansion effectively determine the presence of either the 2-electron dipole contribution or the 1-electron quadrupole contribution, given the respective values of the indices i and j. That is, we observe the 2-electron dipole contribution precisely when $i \\neq j$, and the 1-electron quadrupole contribution when $i=j$. For clarification, we can rewrite $\\hat{Q}^{\\xi\\xi^{'}}(x_i)$ as the following:\n",
    "$$\\hat{Q}^{\\xi\\xi^{'}}(x_i) = -\\hat{\\mu}^{\\xi}(x_i)\\hat{\\mu}^{\\xi^{'}}(x_i)$$\n",
    "In addition to the index-dependent terms listed above, there is also a 1-electron electronic dipole contribution, scaled by the scalar equivalent to $\\lambda\\cdot\\mu_{nuc}-\\lambda\\cdot\\langle\\mu\\rangle$.\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### *Augmentation of HF Routine Using CQED Terms\n",
    "Having completely defined our Hamiltonian, we can now observe the modifications that the CQED approach makes to the canonical RHF procedure. We begin by defining our Fock matrix as:\n",
    "$$F_{\\mu\\nu} = H_{\\mu\\nu} + G_{\\mu\\nu}\\tag{13}$$\n",
    "$H_{\\mu\\nu}$ consists of the core Hamiltonian, $h_{\\mu\\nu}$, (which is equivalent to the potential energy plus the kinetic energy) with both of the 1-electron terms added onto it. $G_{\\mu\\nu}$ consists of two electron integrals multiplied by the density matrix, D, with our CQED 2-electron terms added onto it. \n",
    "Therefore, we get:\n",
    "$$H_{\\mu\\nu} = h_{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\xi,\\xi^{'}}\\lambda^{\\xi}\\lambda^{\\xi^{'}}Q_{\\mu\\nu}^{\\xi\\xi^{'}}+(\\lambda\\cdot\\mu_{nuc}-\\lambda\\cdot\\langle\\mu\\rangle)\\sum_{\\xi}\\lambda^{\\xi}\\mu_{\\mu\\nu}^{\\xi}\\tag{14}$$\n",
    "$$G_{\\mu\\nu}=(2(\\mu\\nu|\\lambda\\sigma)-(\\mu\\lambda|\\nu\\sigma))D_{\\lambda\\sigma}+\\big(\\sum_{\\xi\\xi^{'}}\\lambda^{\\xi}\\lambda^{\\xi^{'}}(2\\mu_{\\mu\\nu}^{\\xi}\\mu_{\\lambda\\sigma}^{\\xi^{'}}-\\mu_{\\mu\\lambda}^{\\xi}\\mu_{\\nu\\sigma}^{\\xi^{'}})\\big)D_{\\lambda\\sigma}\\tag{15}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these two formulas, we can construct a new formulation for the energy related to our CQED modificaiton:\n",
    "$$E_{CQED-RHF} = (F_{\\mu\\nu}+H_{\\mu\\nu})D_{\\mu\\nu} + V_{NN}+d_c\\tag{16}$$\n",
    "Where we take $d_c$ to be equal to:\n",
    "$$d_c = \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda\\cdot\\mu_{nuc})^2 - (\\lambda\\cdot\\langle\\mu\\rangle)(\\lambda\\cdot\\mu_{nuc})+\\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda\\cdot\\langle\\mu\\rangle)^2\\tag{17}$$\n",
    "Again, Equation 16 follows from the typical HF procedure, where we can utilize the following expression from the HF procedure to express our energy in a more convenient manner, based around distributing the density matrix to our one-electron core Hamiltonian, $H$, as well as to our Fock Matrix, $F$:\n",
    "$$E = \\sum(H + F)D\\tag{18}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, our CQED-RHF energy value also contains two additional terms, $V_{N,N}$ and $d_{c}$, which represnt the total repulsive coulomb potential of all nuclei $(V_{N,N})$, as well as a constant term that arises from the consideration of our Dipole Self Energy Hamiltonian. \n",
    "***\n",
    "***\n",
    "### *Outline of the Procedure\n",
    "Now that we have addressed the theory concerning our CQED approach, we will briefly discuss the procedure for calculating energy values using the CQED-RHF approach. This procedure will be demonstrated in a step-wise manner in the upcoming code segment--we are simply outlining the procedure here.\n",
    "* Begin by preparing the necessary terms: kinetic, nuclear attraciton, electron repulsion, dipole, quadrupole -- All of which we are going to gather in the atomic orbital basis via usage of the psi4 framework for simplicity\n",
    "* We simulate the initial loop of the Hartree-Fock procedure, ending with an initial density matrix guess--contracted from coefficients gathered from psi4. The potential energy, kinetic energy, and electron repulsion integrals are additionally gathered in this step, as they will be needed for our calculations.\n",
    "* We initialize the CQED aspect of our procedure, preparing the all necessary terms for our adaptation of the RHF procedure. More specifically, we are leveraging psi4 to prepare $\\langle\\mu\\rangle$ which is developed through gathering twice $\\mu_{(x,y,z)}$ and multiplying it against our guess density matrix. To this, we add $\\mu_{nuc}$ terms--which, again are gathered through psi4-- in respect to $(x,y,z)$. Afterwards, we prepare our polarization-scaled term through summing up component wise products between our polarization vector, $\\lambda$ and our component differentiated $\\mu$ terms. We continue this trend, describing our $\\langle\\mu\\rangle$ and $\\mu_{nuc}$ terms respectively scaled by $\\lambda$\n",
    "* We prepare our dipole energy term, $d_c$, using the same equation presented in Equation 17. In addition to this, we prepare and subsequently uitlize dipole and quadrupole terms in order to augment our core Hamiltonian. Likewise, we augment our Fock matrix with terms gathered via contracting 2 electron dipole integrals with our guess density matrix\n",
    "* From here, we calculate our SCF energy, storing it for future reference as the SCF iteration cycle begins\n",
    "* Next, we diagonalize the Fock matrix, updating our denisty matrix from the new coefficient matrix. This new density matrix is used to update our terms. \n",
    "* Finally, we check for congergence in regards to our calculated energy and density matrix, repeating the process should convergence not be met\n",
