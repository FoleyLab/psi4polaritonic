    "# I. Theoretical Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_{PF}$, is defined in the dipole approximation as:\n",
    "$$\\hat{H}_{PF} = \\hat{H}_e + \\hat{H}_p + \\hat{H}_{ep} + \\hat{H}_{dse}\\tag{1}$$\n",
    "***\n",
    "### *Electronic Term*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The term $\\hat{H}_e$ represents the electronic Hamiltonian and is given through:\n",
    "$$\\hat{H}_e = \\sum^{N_e}_{i} \\hat{T}_e(x_i) + \\sum^{N_e}_i \\sum^{N_N}_A \\hat{V}_{eN}(x_i :X_A) + \\sum^{N_e}_i \\sum^{N_e}_j (\\hat{V}_{ee}(x_i, x_j) + V_{N,N}\\tag{2}$$\n",
    "Where $\\hat{T}_e(x_i)$ is the electronic kinetic operator for electron $i$, $\\hat{V}_{eN}(x_i:X_A)$ is the attractive coulomb operator for electron $i$ and nucleus $A$, $\\hat{V}_{ee}(x_i : x_J)$ is the repulsive coulomb operator for electrons $i$ and $j$, and $V_{N,N}$ is the total repulsive coulomb potential between all nuclei. When using the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation, the term $V_{N,N}$ is treated a constant. Additionally, we can neglect the nuclear kinetic energy, and the electron-nuclear attraction will depend upon the coordinates of the fixed nuclear coordinates.\n",
    "***\n",
    "### *Photonic Term*\n",
    "\n",
    "The next term considered within the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian is the photonic Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_p$, which is defined as:\n",
    "$$\\hat{H}_p = \\omega\\hat{b}^{\\dagger{}}\\hat{b}\\tag{3}$$\n",
    "Here, $\\omega$ represents the frequency of a photon. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### *Bilinear Coupling Term*\n",
    "The third term in the Hamiltonian is a bilinear coupling term that describes coupling of the photonic and electronic degrees of freedom given by, $\\hat{H}_{ep}$ and is defined as:\n",
    "$$\\hat{H}_{ep} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2}}\\left(\\lambda \\cdot (\\hat{\\mu} - \\langle \\mu \\rangle )\\right)\\left(\\hat{b}^{\\dagger{}}+\\hat{b}\\right)\\tag{6}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\lambda$ describes the coupling strength, $\\hat{\\mu}$ is the dipole operator, and $\\langle\\mu\\rangle$ is the molecular dipole expectation value in the ground state. Here, the expectation value has characteristic Cartesian components, denoted by $\\xi$. A given dipole operator with $\\xi$ components is defined through:\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\mu}^{\\xi} = \\sum^{N_e}_i \\hat{\\mu}^\\xi (x_i)+{\\mu}_{nuc}^\\xi \\mid \\xi \\in \\{x,y,z\\}\\tag{7}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\mu^{\\xi}(x_i)$ is defined as an operator that depends upon electronic coordinates, and $\\mu_{nuc}^{\\xi}$ is the nuclear dipole moment where the Cartesian components are treated as functions of the nuclear coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### *Dipole Self Energy Term*\n",
    "The final component of the Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_{dse}$ is the dipole self energy term, and is defined through:\n",
    "$$\\hat{H}_{dse} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\lambda \\cdot (\\hat{\\mu} - \\langle\\mu\\rangle)\\right)^2\\tag{8}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\lambda$ represents the polarization term, $\\hat{\\mu}$ represents the molecular dipole operator and $\\langle\\mu\\rangle$ represents the ground state molecular expeectation value.\n",
    "***\n",
    "### *Hartree-Fock Reference*\n",
    "Having discussed the terms that comprise our Hamiltonian, we can now begin our HF-PF procedure, which we initiate through the introduciton of a product wavefunction, $|R\\rangle$. Here, we define $|R\\rangle$ through the following: \n",
    "$$|R\\rangle = |\\Phi_{0}\\rangle |0\\rangle\\tag{9}$$\n",
    "Here, we have defined $|R\\rangle$ as the product wavefunciton between an electronic Slater determinant, $\\Phi_{0}$ and a zero-photon number state, $|0\\rangle$.  We assume $|\\Phi_{0}\\rangle$ is a restricted reference. We can begin by performing a canonical RHF calculation to initialize the Slater determinant. \n",
    "With $|R\\rangle$ defined, we can now apply Equation 9 to Equation 1, arriving at the following:\n",
    "$$\\langle R|\\hat{H}_{ep}|R\\rangle + \\langle 0|\\hat{H}_{p}|0\\rangle + \\langle \\Phi_{0}| \\hat{H}_{e} + \\hat{H}_{dse}|\\Phi_{0}\\rangle\\tag{10}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are using a zero-photon number state, we find that the $\\hat{H}_{ep}$ and $\\hat{H}_{p}$ terms both go to zero, leaving behind only the $\\hat{H}_e$ and $\\hat{H}_{dse}$. The resulting terms are seen in Equation 11.\n",
    "$$\\langle\\Phi_{0}|\\hat{H}_{e}|\\Phi_{0}\\rangle + \\langle\\Phi_{0}|\\hat{H}_{dse}|\\Phi_{0}\\rangle\\tag{11}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From this new equation, our HF-PF implementation differs from ordinary HF via the dipole self energy term--as $\\hat{H}_{e}$ provides the ordinary RHF energy. \n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Dipole Self Energy Term Expansion\n",
    "In order to better understand the role of the dipole self energy term, we will look at its expansion. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{H}_{dse} = \\sum_{\\xi, \\xi^{'}}\\sum_{i,j>i}\\lambda^{\\xi}\\lambda^{\\xi^{'}}\\hat{\\mu}^{\\xi}(x_i)\\hat{\\mu}^{\\xi^{'}}(x_j) \\\\- \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\xi,\\xi^{'}}\\sum_{i}\\lambda^{\\xi}\\lambda^{\\xi^{'}}\\hat{Q}^{\\xi\\xi^{'}}(x_i) \\\\+ (\\lambda\\cdot\\mu_{nuc}-\\lambda\\cdot\\langle\\mu\\rangle)\\sum_{\\xi}\\sum_{i}\\lambda^{\\xi}\\hat{\\mu}^{\\xi'}(x_i) \\\\+ \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda\\cdot\\mu_{nuc})^2-(\\lambda\\cdot\\langle\\mu\\rangle)(\\lambda\\cdot\\mu_{nuc}) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda\\cdot\\langle\\mu\\rangle))^2\\tag{12}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this expansion of the dipolse self energy term, we observe several unique terms show up. We observe both 1- and 2-electron electronic dipole contributions, as well as 1-electron quadrupole contributions. The first two terms within this expansion effectively determine the presence of either the 2-electron dipole contribution or the 1-electron quadrupole contribution, given the respective values of the indices i and j. That is, we observe the 2-electron dipole contribution precisely when $i \\neq j$, and the 1-electron quadrupole contribution when $i=j$. For clarification, we can rewrite $\\hat{Q}^{\\xi\\xi^{'}}(x_i)$ as the following:\n",
    "$$\\hat{Q}^{\\xi\\xi^{'}}(x_i) = -\\hat{\\mu}^{\\xi}(x_i)\\hat{\\mu}^{\\xi^{'}}(x_i)$$\n",
    "In addition to the index-dependent terms listed above, there is also a 1-electron electronic dipole contribution, scaled by the scalar equivalent to $\\lambda\\cdot\\mu_{nuc}-\\lambda\\cdot\\langle\\mu\\rangle$.\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Augmentation of HF Routine Using PF Terms\n",
    "Having defined our Hamiltonian, we now discuss the modifications that the HF-PF approach makes to the canonical HF procedure. We begin by defining our Fock matrix as:\n",
    "$$F_{\\mu\\nu} = H_{\\mu\\nu} + G_{\\mu\\nu}\\tag{13}$$\n",
    "$H_{\\mu\\nu}$ consists of the core Hamiltonian, $h_{\\mu\\nu}$, (which is equivalent to the potential energy plus the kinetic energy) with both of the 1-electron terms added onto it. $G_{\\mu\\nu}$ consists of two electron integrals multiplied by the density matrix, D, with our PF 2-electron terms added onto it. \n",
    "Therefore, we get:\n",
    "$$H_{\\mu\\nu} = h_{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\xi,\\xi^{'}}\\lambda^{\\xi}\\lambda^{\\xi^{'}}Q_{\\mu\\nu}^{\\xi\\xi^{'}}+(\\lambda\\cdot\\mu_{nuc}-\\lambda\\cdot\\langle\\mu\\rangle)\\sum_{\\xi}\\lambda^{\\xi}\\mu_{\\mu\\nu}^{\\xi}\\tag{14}$$\n",
    "$$G_{\\mu\\nu}=(2(\\mu\\nu|\\lambda\\sigma)-(\\mu\\lambda|\\nu\\sigma))D_{\\lambda\\sigma}+\\big(\\sum_{\\xi\\xi^{'}}\\lambda^{\\xi}\\lambda^{\\xi^{'}}(2\\mu_{\\mu\\nu}^{\\xi}\\mu_{\\lambda\\sigma}^{\\xi^{'}}-\\mu_{\\mu\\lambda}^{\\xi}\\mu_{\\nu\\sigma}^{\\xi^{'}})\\big)D_{\\lambda\\sigma}\\tag{15}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these two formulas, we can construct a new formulation for the energy related to our HF modificaiton:\n",
    "$$E_{HF-PF} = (F_{\\mu\\nu}+H_{\\mu\\nu})D_{\\mu\\nu} + V_{NN}+d_c\\tag{16}$$\n",
    "Where we take $d_c$ to be equal to:\n",
    "$$d_c = \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda\\cdot\\mu_{nuc})^2 - (\\lambda\\cdot\\langle\\mu\\rangle)(\\lambda\\cdot\\mu_{nuc})+\\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda\\cdot\\langle\\mu\\rangle)^2\\tag{17}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the HF-PF energy contains two constant terms, $V_{N,N}$ and $d_{c}$, which represnt the total repulsive coulomb potential of all nuclei $(V_{N,N})$, as well as a constant term that arises from the consideration of our Dipole Self Energy Hamiltonian. \n",
    "***\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Outline of the Procedure\n",
    "Now that we have addressed the theory related to our HF-PF approach, we will briefly outline the algorithm, which differs only in a few minor details from the canonical HF algorithm. This procedure will be demonstrated in a step-wise manner in the upcoming code segment--we are simply outlining the procedure here.\n",
    "1. Compute kinetic, nuclear attraction, electron repulsion, dipole, and quadrupole integrals in AO basis\n",
    "2. Perform canonical RHF calculation\n",

    "Now that we have our initial energies calculated and our convergences set, we can begin the SCF procedure. This procedure effectively follows the typical HF procedure, however, here we are considering two additional terms to append to the Fock matrix. These terms constitute the two electron contribution, seen in equation 15. These terms take on the shape of the J and K matrices that arise in the typical HF procedure. The created Fock matrix is comprised of all four of these terms. In addition, we will add on our core Hamiltonian--which has already been adapted to consider our CQED contributions--to the Fock matrix. We will use this Fock matrix as well as our initial Density matrix to calculate the self consistent field energy--in which we also consider our nuclear repulsion energy and dipole energy.\n",

    "With our first energy calculated, we will now diagonalize our Fock matrix to gather a new coefficient matrix. We use this to build a new density matrix. \n",
    "With the new density matrix established, we must update our electronic dipole expectation values, to which we add the nuclear dipole terms as well. Additionally, we will update the expectation value of the polarization vector-electronic dipole dot product, as well as the 1 electron dipole term.\n",
