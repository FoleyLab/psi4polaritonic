helper_cqed_rhf.py -> fully simplified version that only includes dipole "K" matrix and Q matrix; no iterative updates to <\mu>_el
helper_cqed_rhf_el.py -> partially simplified version that only includes electronic part of dipole terms; iterative updates to <\mu>_el required
helper_cqed_rhf_el_nuc.py -> non-simplified version that includes electroic and nuclear parts of dipole terms; iterative updates to <\mu> required
