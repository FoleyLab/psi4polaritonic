    "A mean-field description of the excited states of the molecular system strongly interacting with photonic degrees of freedom, and a correction to the ground-state that contains coupling between the PF-HF reference and simultaneous electronic and photonic excitations, may be obtained through a configuration interaction  ansatz that includes up to simultaneous single excitations of the electronic and photonic degrees of freedom.  Although previously referred to as the CQED-CIS ansatz\\cite{Foley_154103}, here we refer to this as the CISS-PF method \n",
    "to denote that simultaneous single excitations on the electron and photon degrees of freedom are included in this ansatz, and to denote the specific application \n",
    "of this ansatz to the PF Hamiltonian in Eq. (1).   In the following presentation, we assume the PF-HF reference which will be computed by a helper function imported by this notebook.\n",

    "CISS-PF ansatz can be written as a linear combination of the PF-HF reference and products of all possible single excitations out of the PF-HF reference.  The PF-HF reference involves the product of an electronic Slater determinant with the photon vacuum state $|\\Phi_o\\rangle |0\\rangle$, so single excitations can occur as electronic excitations from an occupied orbital $\\phi_i$ to a virtual orbital $\\phi_a$, the raising of the photon number state from $|0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1\\rangle$, or both.
